# School-related-project-info-and-experience

After graduation this is where I will put my trimmed functions I have found handy throughout my time at UNLV.
Until then this will document my experiences so far as a reference. Feel free to message me if you would like to see the code.

Experience:

-Game Playing Heuristic Solver in Golang

Implemented a program that solves 15 puzzles. Written in golang, this solver uses either bi-directional A* or Best First searches in combination with the manhattan distance+linear conflicts heuristic.

-XV6 in C:

Worked in X86 to implement sorting and searching algorithms, scheduling algorithms, along with base conversion and concurrency.

Implemented the UNIX top command in xv6. This included modifications inside the kernel to kill tasks, and the addition of required syscalls.

Implemented timed I/O syscall in XV6 within the console to go along with the top command, in order to implement periodic refresh.

-Java Compiler

Implemented a compiler for the Java language, written in Java. This project dealt with tokenization, parsing, generation of parse trees, type/modifier checking, and bytecode generation.

-Espresso Virtual Machine:

Worked on a simulation of the Java JVM virtual machine in Java: simulating the operand stack, processing the instructions of java byte code and executing them, along with processing user program threads.

-Quorum iOS Bridge using MobiVM's RobmVM

Integrated Robovm into the Quorum Language's gradle build structure, taking the existing JDK 8 compiler output and configuring the compiler for transpilation to objective-c, allowing for testing and future support on iOS devices packaged directly into the Quorum toolchain. 

-Windows Forms Graphics Projects

Completed various projects using C# and Windows Forms, including projects focused on raytracing, animation, rotation, movement and Mandlebrot/julia set graphing/interaction.

Classes taken:

-Data Structures

-Analysis of Algorithms

-Formal Automata

-Computer Architecture and Organization

-Assembly and Systems Programming
