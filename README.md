# School-related-project-info-and-experience

After graduation this is where I will put my trimmed functions I have found handy throughout my time at UNLV.
Until then this will document my experiences so far as a reference. Feel free to message me if you would like to see the code.

Experience:

Espresso Virtual Machine:

Working on a simulation of the Java JVM virtual machine in Java: simulating the operand stack, processing the instructions of java byte code and executing them, along with processing user program threads.

XV6 in C:

Worked in X86 to implement sorting and searching algorithms, scheduling algorithms, along with base conversion and concurrency.

Implemented the UNIX top command in xv6.

Implemented timed I/O in XV6 to go along with the top command, in order to implement auto refresh.
