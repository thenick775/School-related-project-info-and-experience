# School-related-project-info-and-experience

After graduation this is where I will put my trimmed functions I have found handy throughout my time at UNLV.
Until then this will document my experiences so far as a reference.

Experience:
Working on the XV6 operating system in C: including scheduling algorithms, different forms of mutex locks, threading, and I have implemented a scaled down version of the Unix Top Command.

Working on a simulation of the Java JVM virtual machine in Java: simulating the operand stack, processing the instructions of java byte code and executing them, along with processing user program threads.

Worked in X86 to implement sorting and searching algorithms along with base conversion and concurrency.
